Twitter trends is a project to develop a geographic visualization of Twitter data across the USA.
Key points: Collecting public Twitter posts (tweets) that have been tagged with geographic locations and filtering for those that contain the "texas" query term,
Assigning a sentiment (positive or negative) to each tweet, based on all of the words it contains,
Aggregating tweets by the state with the closest geographic center, and finally
Coloring each state according to the aggregate sentiment of its tweets. Red means positive sentiment; blue means negative.


In Hog, two players alternate turns trying to reach 100 points first. On each turn, the current player chooses some number of dice to roll, up to 10. Her turn score is the sum of the dice outcomes, unless any of the dice come up a 1, in which case the score for her turn is only 1 point (the Pig out rule).
To spice up the game, we will play with some special rules:
Free bacon. If a player chooses to roll zero dice, she scores one more than the largest digit in her opponent's score. For example, if Player 1 has 42 points, Player 0 gains 1 + max(4, 2) = 5 points by rolling zero dice. If Player 1 has 48 points, Player 0 gains 1 + max(4, 8) = 9 points.
Hog wild. If the sum of both players' total scores is a multiple of seven (e.g., 14, 21, 35), then the current player rolls four-sided dice instead of the usual six-sided dice.
Swine swap. If at the end of a turn one of the player's total score is exactly double the other's, then the players swap total scores. Example 1: Player 0 has 20 points and Player 1 has 5; it is Player 1's turn. She scores 5 more, bringing her total to 10. The players swap scores: Player 0 now has 10 points and Player 1 has 20. It is now Player 0's turn. Example 2: Player 0 has 90 points and Player 1 has 50; it is Player 0's turn. She scores 10 more, bringing her total to 100. The players swap scores, and Player 1 wins the game 100 to 50.
